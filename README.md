# Simple spell checker

A simple word checking program which uses custom implementation of Hash Tables using open addressing and double hashing strategy. It takes a misspelled word which does not exist in the dictionary, and tries to do different sorts of modifications on it. If a match is found from the dictionary, the suggestion is printed out in the console.
